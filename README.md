# Clifs Catalog V2
### Starting from scratch with new technologies, this will be a more up-to-date version of Clif's Catalog

I have decided to pair with *__Jason Vallery__* to tag team this project

#### Technologies that are being leveraged:
- React/Next.js/TypeScript
- Next-Auth for authentication
- Prisma for backend (User database)
- Spoonacular (API endpoints)

__The name of the project is to be changed, seeing as Jason is joining the project__

The inspiration comes from my first Clif's Catalog project, but is being extended to something greater. We are leveraging a new site for our API endpoints that has a greater store of information/meals/recipes. With the new app, our users are able to sign up by creating an account, set preferences to enhance the search for recipes/meals, and even favorite meals to their account for later! All of this comes with similar functionality to the previous app, with some new upgrades as well.

#### Introducing: My Sous-chef
**My Sous-chef** can really do a lot, however its core functionality in the app is to help indecesive users. Extra functionality also includes, but is not limited to, helping users discover new recipes/meals, finding names of meals/recipes that are lost to the user, and more. This feature leverages Vercel's new AI SDK to incorporate OpenAI's Chat-GPT into our app.

#### Follow Along: 

We are currently still in the developmental stage of the creation process. Star the repo, and follow along as we make daily improvements to better the app for our users. 

### Previously :

### A web app for finding an optimal meal suggestion for you based off of personal preferences, previous favorites, or a randomly generated suggestion.

#### Thank you for checking out my repository for my latest project. I have recently started throwing together this web app as an extension to a previous project. I plan to have full spectrum usage with this web app, from the front-end to the back-end: including account creation + database storing meal favorites. 

#### The idea originally started as a project to create a random meal suggestion. As seen in my meal repository, my wife and I are very indecesive. I created this random meal suggestion app in efforts to combat our indecesiveness; this way, whenever we don't know what to eat, we can just grab a suggestion from this app. However, after browsing for a new project to dive into, I decided to expand on my previous work with this. 

#### It has been very interesting diving into the usage of API's (TheMealDB API was used for this project). Learning how to iterate through the data obtained from API Fetch proved to be difficult, but I always love a good challenge. Another big challenge endured throughout this project was deciding how to handle user authentication; I ended up going with Auth0 for my authentication purposes.

#### In the future, I will be adding more things like stated before, such as meals recommended based off preferred meal styles and meal favorites history. I am looking forward to the end result.
