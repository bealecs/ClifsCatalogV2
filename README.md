# Next Meal üçéüçî
### View the build preview of the main branch [here](https://next-meal-cookbook.vercel.app/) and follow along as we build

**[Jason Vallery](https://github.com/JVSONV) and [Clif Beale](https://github.com/bealecs) are tag teaming this project**

#### Technologies that are being leveraged:
- React/Next.js/TypeScript
- Next-Auth for authentication
- Prisma for backend (User database)
- Spoonacular (API endpoints)

The inspiration comes from one of Clif's initial projects as a web developer: Clif's Catalog. However, the new app will be being extended to something greater. We are leveraging a new site for our API endpoints that has a greater store of information/meals/recipes. With the new app, our users are able to sign up by creating an account, set preferences to enhance the search for recipes/meals, and even favorite meals to their account for later! All of this comes with similar functionality to the previous app, with some new upgrades as well.

#### Introducing: My Sous-chef
**My Sous-chef** can really do a lot, however its core functionality in the app is to help indecesive users. Extra functionality also includes, but is not limited to, helping users discover new recipes/meals, finding names of meals/recipes that are lost to the user, and more. This feature leverages Vercel's new AI SDK to incorporate OpenAI's Chat-GPT into our app.

#### Follow Along: 

We are currently still in the developmental stage of the creation process. Star the repo, and follow along as we make daily improvements to better the app for our users.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
